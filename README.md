# Accessing Allen Institute's Cell Types Ephys data

I put together an [example ipython notebook](https://github.com/stripathy/AIBS_cell_types/blob/master/Allen_ephys_playground.ipynb) on downloading an example [AIBS cell types ephys raw dataset](http://celltypes.brain-map.org/mouse/experiment/electrophysiology/354190013) using python code. 

I also show how to query the [Allen Institute's Cell Types API](http://help.brain-map.org//display/celltypes/API) to get their pre-calculated summary measurements. I think provide an example of comparing these single-cell measurements to similar previously published values by querying the [NeuroElectro database](neuroelectro.org).
