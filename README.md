# Accessing Allen Institute's Cell Types Ephys data

I put together an example ipython notebook on downloading an example AIBS cell types ephys raw dataset using python code. I also show how to query the [Allen Institute's Cell Types API](http://help.brain-map.org//display/celltypes/API) to get their pre-calculated summary measurements and then compare these to similar previously published measurements by querying the [NeuroElectro database](neuroelectro.org).
